                <h1 class = "header_text">  You always made me laugh. I bet I also did make you laugh several times ðŸ˜‚. You made me feel not lonely. Ever since you came i felt a change in my heart. You are loyal. You are gorgeous and the most important thing of all that you are trustworthy. I shared things to you that i didnt even share with my closest friend. So here im confessing. I know theres chance you might not accept. But its always worth a try as you told me ðŸ˜‚. I made this thing a long time ago and didnt have enough courage to send it to you. But now I do. Soo Areebah can i be your bf ðŸ˜ƒ</h1>
